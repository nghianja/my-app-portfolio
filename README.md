Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project 0

## Why this Project?

The goals of this project are:

1. For you to build an app layout that showcases the apps you will build across your Nanodegree journey.
2. To introduce you to the process of submitting a project for review. You will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that you go through the process early.
3. To familiarize you with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on your code is a key part of the Nanodegree program.
  * Note: Unlike your other projects, this first project will not be evaluated as "pass" or "no pass" -- all submissions will pass and get feedback.

## Required Tasks

1. Download Android Studio. Check out our mini-course on How to Download Android Studio if you need help.

2. Create a new project in Android Studio using the "Application with blank activity" template.

3. Create a layout for your main activity, adding a title, buttons for each app, and a style of your choosing.

   You can begin working in either the text view or design view (whichever you prefer) within Android Studio's Layout Editor.

   Here is a screenshot of the Design View, for those of you who are new to Android Studio.

   Note that if you start in the design view, it's often a best practice to return to the text view to make final tweaks as this mode offers the most precision and control over your layout attributes.
   
## Colors and Styles

When designing your layout for the project portfolio, you may enjoy customizing the style and color of your buttons and changing the layout. If you are interested in learning about colors you can use, take a look at the material design color page, from Google.

If you'd like your app to look Udacious, feel free to use #F08C35 to match the orange buttons on our site.

1. In the Java source for your main activity, enable your buttons to respond to click or touch events.

2. Display a toast within the methods you created in the last step.

   You should see a message like this whenever a button is clicked!
